# Secret Message Exercise
**Full Name** - Secret Message Exercise.\
**Development Environment** - Visual Studio 2022.\
**Language**  - Python.\
**Status**    - Done.\
<<<<<<< HEAD
**Purpose**   - A technical ability exercise.\

## Overview
**Purpose** - This is my first Python project which was the technical test in a Job Application.  It demonstrates my flexability in applying skills to new languages and technologies.\

### Specification
Task - To write a short routine to accept the URL of a Google Document website, the site will contain a table with the following columns :-
1. **X-Coordinate** - This is the characters X-Coordinate final position.\
2. **Character** - This is the character to be printed.\
3. **Y-Coordinate** - This is the characters Y-Coordinate final position.\

When the characters are printed at the correct coordinates a secret Message will be displayed in Uppercase letters, and should be completed in either Javascript or Python.\

### Solution
1. **showMessage(URL)** - The Entry Method Accepts the URL parameter & calls the appropriate methods in turn.\
2. **getData(URL)** - Gets the Data from the response of the URL request and returns the string docData.\
3. **parseGoogleDocData(docData)** - Creates & populates a dictionary using the coordinates as the indexes and Character as the value stored. returns message dictionary object.\
4. **printSecretMessage(message)** - Prints the Characters at the coordinates revealing the message in the console.\
